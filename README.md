# Dove_image_preprocessing
Python tools for pre-processing Dove imagery. This files are fairly informal and uploaded just to 
help those who may need them. 

Planet_masking_udm_and_udm2 is a Jupyter notebook for masking a Dove image using the included
UDM an UDM2 files.  Feel free to download and edit as needed. 

TopoCorrectionClass is a class I wrote to make topographical correction of Dove imagery easy. 
Also in a Jupyter notebook, the class is on top and the use is underneath it. Selected references
to the methods are in the code. I didn't create these methods -- I just coded them for Dove imagery.
